# BrainfuckCE VCPP
A vcpp wrapper of the bytecode compiler and interpreter. Useful for debugging. It can compile the ez80 native code on windows, but it obviously can't run it.

I don't have experience uploading visual studio projects to github. If it doesn't work for your computer, create an issue so I can try to fix it! ;D
